		<h1 class="display-4">Police Accountability Board</h1> 
          
			<p style="text-align: justify;">The City of Rochester fails to hold police officers accountable for misconduct and brutality. 
			Between 2001 and 2016, citizens filed <span>929 allegations of excessive force</span> against the RPD. 
			The Chief of Police, who has the sole power to discipline officers, <span>only sustained 16</span> of these allegations.
			 This is <span>injustice</span>. 
			 And the reason is obvious: the Chief of Police cannot be expected to investigate, evaluate, and discipline police officers. 
			 This is a <span>clear conflict of interest</span>. 
			 Even in the rare instance that the Chief does discipline an officer, the punishment is inadequate; 
			 Between 2002 and 2016, <span>only 13 officers were disciplined</span>, of those only 6 were suspended, and <span>none were fired</span>. 
			 Police misconduct will continue unless this broken system is replaced with an independent system that serves the interest of the people of Rochester not the RPD.</p>
 
			<p style="text-align: justify;">A coalition of community organizations came together in 2017 and proposed a Police Accountability Board (PAB) to replace the current broken system. 
			The proposed PAB would be a civilian led oversight board that is rooted in <span>five essential pillars</span>:</p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>an independent agency of city government, separate from RPD, with a budget equivalent to 1% of RPD's</li>
			<li>independent investigative authority</li>
			<li>subpoena power</li>
			<li>disciplinary power through a disciplinary matrix</li>
			<li>power to assess RPD policies and procedures and make recommendations</li>		  
		</ul>
	      <p style="text-align: justify;">The majority of the board members of the PAB would be nominated by a <span>coalition of the Rochester community organizations</span> called the <span>Police Accountability Board Alliance</span>. The Alliance removes the conflict of interest and replaces it with a <span>democratic, civilian-lead oversight system</span>.</p>
	      
		<h3>Intro Version 2</h3>
		<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The Problem:</span> The City of Rochester <span>fails to hold police officers accountable for misconduct and brutality.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Between 2001 and 2016, citizens filed <span>923 allegations of excessive force against the RPD. </li>
<li>The Chief of Police, who has the sole power to discipline officers, <span>only sustained 16 of these allegations</span>.</li>
<li>The Chief of Police cannot be expected to investigate, evaluate, and discipline police officers. This is a clear <span>conflict of interest</span>. </li>
<li>Between 2002 and 2016, <span>only 13 officers were disciplined</span>. Of those disciplined, <span>only 6 were suspended. None were fired.</span> </li>
<li>For more information and data about the current system and how it has failed, see [link to Ted and Barbara’s report]. </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Police misconduct will continue unless this broken system is replaced with an <span>independent system</span> that serves the interests of the people of Rochester, not just the RPD.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The Solution:</span> A coalition of community organizations came together in 2017 and proposed a <span>Police Accountability Board (PAB)</span> to replace the current broken system. The proposed PAB would be a <span>civilian led oversight board</span> that is rooted in five essential pillars:</p>

		  <ul>
		  	<li>an independent agency of city government, separate from RPD</li>
			<li>The power to independently investigate complaints of police misconduct</li>
			<li>Subpoena power to compel the production of evidence and witnesses</li>
			<li>Disciplinary power</li>
			<li>The power to review and evaluate RPD patterns, practices, policies and procedures to recommend systemic changes and to prevent misconduct from happening in the first place.</li>		  
		</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the five pillars, <span>sufficient funding is required</span> so that complaints of misconduct are resolved efficiently and effectively in 90 days. To handle the volume of complaints that are filed in Rochester, the PAB will require a funding equal to <span>1% of RPD’s budget</span>, one million dollars, a reasonable cost of true accountability, and an investment which will result in far fewer costly lawsuits against the city involving excessive force.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The majority of the board members of the PAB would be nominated by a coalition of the Rochester community organizations called the Police Accountability Board Alliance. The Alliance removes the conflict of interest and replaces it with a <span>civilian-lead oversight system</span>, empowering the communities that have had no direct control over how they are policed for far too long.</p>
